            <h5>Trafalgar Square history</h5>
            <p>      Trafalgar Square is named after Britain’s victory in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Although Britain won, war hero Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson was killed during the battle on his ship, HMS Victory. Nelson's contribution was remembered with Nelson’s Column, a key feature of the square.
        
            </p>

            <p>  The site of Trafalgar Square was previously the Royal Mews from the 14th to the 17th centuries. The mews moved to its current location at Buckingham Palace in the early 19th century.
        
        </p> 
        <p>  John Nash subsequently redesigned the square, which officially opened in 1844. More recently, it was redeveloped to include a pedestrianised area at the north of the square in 2003.
         
        </p>     
        <p>  During its history, the square has been a place for protests, demonstrations and large-scale events, which continues to this day.
